- 👋 Hi, I’m Dunsin.

- 👀 I am very interested in data analytics because I believe that it can be a very powerful tool for making better decisions. I like working with data because it allows me to see patterns and relationships that otherwise might not be apparent. I also enjoy the challenge of finding new and creative ways to use data to improve decision making.

- 🌱 I am learning in SQL, R, Tableau and Advanced Excel.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in various fields.
